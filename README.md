# MCalendar

This project is a  Calendar displayed a bit like an almanach.
Eg the "Almanach des PTT" was famous in France
It displays moon faces and the time at which it occurs.

To build it, you need to install the Qt libraries and the g++ compiler.

Then run Make in each subdir will build the executables.

The project is still on run (with some bugs though) but the main is on rail
and works rather well.
